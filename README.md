# UBUNTU + i3 

I use this directory in order to quickly set up my linux environment on other computers. Anyone is welcome to copy this configuration including my .bashrc.

* These tools assume you are using Ubuntu 16.04

* There are some useful tools and aliases in .bashrc

* I use this directory in conjunction with cavim, my customized vim /.vimrc configuration, but keeping this configuration in a separate repo to remove clutter.
